                <h1>Lesson 2: The Prime Directive</h1>

                <p>The War Room system operates on one unbreakable rule. Everything else—every mode, every technique, every workflow—derives from this single directive:</p>

                <div class="directive-box">
                    AI generates. You execute. You document. Reality decides.
                </div>

                <p>This is not philosophy. It's operational discipline. The AI generates possibilities. You execute what it suggests. You document what happened. Reality determines if it worked. No skipped steps. No exceptions.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

                <p>Most AI users stop at generation. They get output, say "that's useful," and move on. They never execute. They never test against reality. This creates the illusion of progress without actual results.</p>

                <p>War Room operators complete the loop. Generation without execution is theory. Execution without documentation is chaos. Documentation without reality-testing is delusion. All four steps happen, or you're not operating—you're browsing.</p>

                <h2>The Four Steps</h2>

                <p><strong>AI Generates:</strong> The system produces options, frameworks, strategies based on your prompts. It's fast, creative, and has no attachment to any single answer.</p>

                <p><strong>You Execute:</strong> You take one option and test it in the real world. Real customers. Real budget. Real constraints. No "I'll try this later."</p>

                <p><strong>You Document:</strong> You record what you did, what happened, and what you learned. Not feelings—data. Results. Failures. Proof.</p>

                <p><strong>Reality Decides:</strong> The market, your customers, your metrics tell you if it worked. Not the AI. Not your intuition. Reality is the only judge.</p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>War Room Rule:</strong> If you didn't document it, you didn't learn from it. If you didn't execute it, you didn't test it. If reality didn't judge it, you don't know if it works.
